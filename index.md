# Welcome

This website aims to answer one simple question:

    How do I get to the 2018 Colorado Aspirations in Computing Awards?

I'm glad you asked!

This year the awards event is being held in a place with an unbelievably cool name: **The Multipurpose Room**.

That's right, this room has MANY purposes and ONE of them is to host awards events. That's a good thing too, given why we are coming together on Saturday!

Where is this multipurpose room located? In a far-off place, known as Williams Village at the University of Colorado Boulder.
