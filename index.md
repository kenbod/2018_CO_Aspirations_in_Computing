  <p><strong>How do I get to the 2018 Colorado Aspirations in Computing Awards?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm glad you asked!</p>

<p>This year the awards event is being held in a place with an unbelievably cool name: <strong>The Multipurpose Room</strong>.</p>

<p>That's right, this room has MANY purposes and ONE of them is to host awards events. That's a good thing too, given why we are coming together on Saturday!</p>

<p>Where is this multipurpose room located?</p>

<p>In a far-off place, known as Williams Village at the University of Colorado Boulder.</p>

<p>When most people think of Williams Village, they think of these lovely, aesthetic, um, orange buildings that everyone sees when they drive into Boulder</p>

<p>These are NOT the buildings you are looking for. If you see this sign:</p>

<p>then you have found the WRONG building.</p>
