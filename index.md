<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>This website aims to answer one simple question:</p>

<p><blockquote><strong>How do I get to the 2018 Colorado Aspirations in Computing Awards?</strong></blockquote></p>

<p>I'm glad you asked!</p>

<p>This year the awards event is being held in a place with an unbelievably cool name: <strong>The Multipurpose Room</strong>.</p>

<p>That's right, this room has MANY purposes and ONE of them is to host awards events. That's a good thing too, given why we are coming together on Saturday!</p>

<p>Where is this multipurpose room located?</p>

<p>In a far-off place, known as Williams Village at the University of Colorado Boulder.</p>
