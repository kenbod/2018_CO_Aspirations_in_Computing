<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>The 2018 Colorado Aspirations in Computing Awards will be held on Saturday, April 28, 2018! We hope you're excited as we are for the event!</p>

<p>The program starts at 1 PM; you should arrive at 12:30 PM-ish to check in and get settled before everything gets underway. But, you probably have a question:</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
  <p class="mb-0"><strong>How did Prof. Anderson make this website?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, not that question! Try again:</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
  <p class="mb-0"><strong>How do I get to the 2018 Colorado Aspirations in Computing Awards?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm glad you asked!</p>

<p>This year the awards event is being held in a place with an unbelievably cool name: <strong>The Multipurpose Room</strong>.</p>

<p>That's right, this room has MANY purposes and ONE of them is to host awards events. That's a good thing too, given why we are coming together on Saturday!</p>

<p>Where is this multipurpose room located?</p>

<p>In a far-off place, known as Williams Village at the University of Colorado Boulder.</p>

<p>When most people think of Williams Village, they think of these lovely, aesthetic, um, orange buildings that everyone sees when they drive into Boulder</p>

<p>These are NOT the buildings you are looking for. If you see this sign:</p>

<img src="images/ntbyalf_sign.jpg" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="width: 50%" alt="darley">

<p>then you have found the WRONG building.</p>

<p>Fortunately, all you have to do is look to your left and you will see the CORRECT building!</p>

<img src="images/this_is_it.jpg" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="width: 50%" alt="dining hall">

<p>Unfortunately, you're standing on the north side of the building and you want to be on the southwest side of the building. If you go there, you'll see this sign:</p>

<img src="images/the_right_sign.jpg" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="width: 50%" alt="the correct sign">

<p>And, you will know you're almost there. The building you're looking for looks like this from the south:</p>

<img src="images/this_is_it_2.jpg" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="width: 50%" alt="dining hall from the south">

<p>If you go through those doors, then, <strong>CONGRATS</strong>, you've found the 2018 Colorado Aspirations in Computing Awards!</p>

<h1>Parking</h1>

<p>Now, hold on a minute. You can't very well walk through those doors if you haven't found a place to park! So, what are your options?</p>

<img src="images/annotated_map.jpg" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="width: 75%" alt="annotated map">

<p>Your options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Blue: Go to this lot and pay for parking.</li>
  <li>Orange: Try to find parking along this street.</li>
  <li>Green: Try to find parking in this shopping center across the street.</li>
  <li>Red: This is the building you're looking for. You can't park on a building.</li>
  <li>Final Option: Head North!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Paid Parking Lot</h2>

<p>If you want to pay for parking, head to the lot highlighted in blue. You'll see this sign when you're in the right place:</p>

<img src="images/blue_parking_sign.jpg" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="width: 50%" alt="blue_parking_sign">

<p>as well as this sign:</p>

<img src="images/aggro_sign_1.jpg" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="width: 50%" alt="aggro">

<p>Once parked (if there is a spot available), then use this simple, well-designed parking station to pay for parking:</p>

<img src="images/not_complex.jpg" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="width: 50%" alt="not simple">

<p>Then head towards the southwest side of this building:</p>

<img src="images/this_is_it_3.jpg" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="width: 50%" alt="this is still it">

<p>and head through the magic doors!</p>

<h2>30th Street</h2>

<p>The orange line on the map is 30th Street; it looks like this facing east:</p>

<img src="images/30th_east_ish.jpg" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="width: 50%" alt="facing east">

<p>and like this, when facing west:</p>

<img src="images/30th_west_ish.jpg" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="width: 50%" alt="facing west">

<p>If there is a spot available, you should be able to park there.</p>

<h2>Shopping Center</h2>

<p>If you can't find parking in the paid lot or on 30th, you can try to park over at the shopping center across the street. It looks like this:</p>

<img src="images/maybe_here1.jpg" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="width: 50%" alt="shopping center 1">

<p>and this:</p>

<img src="images/maybe_here2.jpg" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="width: 50%" alt="shopping center 2">

<p>and comes with its own slightly agressive parking sign:</p>

<img src="images/aggro_sign_2.jpg" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="width: 50%" alt="aggro sign 2">

<p>(What is up with the designers of parking lot signs?)</p>

<p>I've parked in this parking lot many times for events in Williams Village and have never had a problem. However, your mileage may vary.</p>

<h2>Heading North</h2>

<p>The last option is to head north on 30th street:</p>

<img src="images/head_north_young_woman.jpg" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="width: 50%" alt="head north">

<p>Up this street, on the left and right, are many neighborhoods with (mainly) student housing. You should be able to find parking in these neighborhoods as a last resort. You will then have to walk south and find the magic doors on the southwest side of the building marked in red!</p>

<h1>Wrapping Up</h1>

<p>I hope you found this information useful and I wish you much success on your parking-related Odyssey. My team and I cannot wait to see you and your family so we can celebrate your accomplishments in computing!!</p>

<p>See you soon!</p>
