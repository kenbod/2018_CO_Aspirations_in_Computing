<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>The 2018 Colorado Aspirations in Computing Awards will be held on Saturday, April 28, 2018! We hope you're excited as we are for the event!</p>

<p>The program starts at 1 PM; you should arrive at 12:30 PM-ish to check in and get settled before everything gets underway. But, you probably have a question:</p>

  <p class="mb-0"><strong>How did Prof. Anderson make this website?</strong></p>

<p>No, not that question! Try again:</p>

<p>I'm glad you asked!</p>

<p>This year the awards event is being held in a place with an unbelievably cool name: <strong>The Multipurpose Room</strong>.</p>

<p>That's right, this room has MANY purposes and ONE of them is to host awards events. That's a good thing too, given why we are coming together on Saturday!</p>

<p>Where is this multipurpose room located?</p>

<p>In a far-off place, known as Williams Village at the University of Colorado Boulder.</p>

<p>When most people think of Williams Village, they think of these lovely, aesthetic, um, orange buildings that everyone sees when they drive into Boulder</p>

<p>These are NOT the buildings you are looking for. If you see this sign:</p>

<img src="images/ntbyalf_sign.jpg" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="width: 50%" alt="darley">

<p>then you have found the WRONG building.</p>

<p>Fortunately, all you have to do is look to your left and you will see the CORRECT building!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, you're standing on the north side of the building and you want to be on the southwest side of the building. If you go there, you'll see this sign:</p>

<img src="images/the_right_sign.jpg" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="width: 50%" alt="darley">

<p>And, you will know you're almost there. The building you're looking for looks like this from the south:</p>

<p>If you go through those doors, then congrats, you've found the 2018 Colorado Aspirations in Computing Awards!</p>
